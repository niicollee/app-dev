### My favorite movie is Harry Potter
## Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels that became a movie series
**The Harry Potter series proved incredibly popular with both children and adults worldwide.**
*The phenomenon introduced new terms*
> The movie is about a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
1. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal.
2. On the first movie, a new teacher at the school that year tries to steal a stone that’s guarded by the headmaster of the school, Albus Dumbledore, because it’s an elixir of life. It’s up to the trio to try and stop him.
3. On the second movie, Ron’s sister Ginny gets hold of an old diary which belonged to adolescent Voldemort.
4. He uses her to open the Chamber of Secrets which houses a monstrous snake that especially targets muggle.
5. Harry and Ron are bound to solve the issues and save everyone including Hermione and Ginny.
- On the third movie, a prisoner escapes from Azkaban (the prison of the magical world) and he turns out to be Harry’s Godfather, Sirius Black, who happened to be his parents’ best friend.
- Everyone thinks Sirius is after Harry while in fact he’s just after the rat. In the series of events that follow, Harry realizes that Sirius is innocent and tries to save him from the prison guards.
- On the fourth movie, there's a competition called the Tri-Wizard Tournament between three wizarding schools and it’s extremely dangerous.
- Someone nominates Harry’s name though he’s under-age and he’s chastised by people because they think he did it himself for fame.
- He survives the tournament and with another student of Hogwarts, Cedric, reached the trophy first. They both touch it at the same time and are transported to another place.
> Voldemort came back to life and Cedric got killed then Harry somehow escapes with Cedric’s body.
> On the fifth movie, very few people believe that Voldemort’s back. Even the Ministry of Magic is ignorant and they tag Harry and Dumbledore as liars. The trio form a group of students and name it Dumbledore’s Army and train them to face Voldemort some day.
> On the sixth movie, it is mostly about a book owned by “The half blood prince”, whose name I’m not revealing. Harry learns more about Voldemort’s life and how he’s divided his life into little parts and put them in different objects like the diary in the 2nd part, a ring, a locket, etc.
> On the seventh and eight movie, the trio set out to destroy the parts mentioned in the sixth movie, the world having been taken over by Voldemort and his people.
